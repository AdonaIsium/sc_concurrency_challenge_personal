# 🗺️ Progression Map - Your Tech Tree

> *"Just like you can't build Siege Tanks without a Factory, or cast Force of Will without blue mana, you can't master advanced patterns without the fundamentals. Here's your tech tree."*

This map shows how concepts build on each other. You must complete prerequisites before advancing. Think of this as your StarCraft tech tree or MTG mana curve.

## 🎯 Alternative Paths

### Path 1: Bottom-Up (Recommended)
```
Boot Camp → Mission 1 → Mission 2 → Mission 3 → Mission 4 → Final
(Learn foundations, build complexity gradually)
```

### Path 2: Use-Case Driven
```
Boot Camp → Mission 2 → Mission 1 → Mission 3 → Mission 4 → Final
(Resource management before unit management)
```

### Path 3: Rapid Prototyping
```
Boot Camp → Skip to Final Mission → Debug → Fill Gaps → Missions 1-4
(Not recommended for deep learning, but valid for experienced developers)
```

**Recommendation**: Path 1 for first-time learners, Path 2 if you have specific interest in resource management, Path 3 only if you have prior concurrency experience and just want to see patterns.

## 🔥 Pro Tips for Progression

**From Flash (Macro Management)**:
> "In StarCraft, you don't build every building at once. You unlock tech in order. Same here—master the primitives before attempting advanced patterns."

**From Bisu (Strategic Thinking)**:
> "I don't memorize every build. I understand why builds work, so I can adapt. Learn WHY each pattern exists, not just HOW to implement it."

**From Jaedong (Adaptation)**:
> "Sometimes the opponent forces you to change strategy mid-game. If a concept isn't clicking, try a different analogy or example. Find what works for YOUR brain."

**From Jon Finkel (Deep Understanding)**:
> "Great Magic players understand layers, priority, and the stack deeply. Great Go programmers understand goroutines, channels, and synchronization deeply. There are no shortcuts to mastery."

1. Can I explain goroutines without looking at notes?
2. Can I write a program with channels that doesn't deadlock?
3. Do I understand WHY mutexes prevent data races?
4. Can I use WaitGroups without looking up syntax?

**Before Mission 2**:
5. Can I implement a worker pool from scratch?
6. Do I understand graceful shutdown patterns?
7. Can I use select with multiple channels?
8. Do I know when context should be used?

**Before Mission 3**:
9. Can I design a resource allocation system?
10. Do I understand deadlock prevention strategies?
11. Can I explain priority scheduling?
12. Have I handled real resource contention?

**Before Mission 4**:
13. Can I build event-driven systems?
14. Do I understand real-time constraints?
15. Can I maintain state consistency?
16. Can I profile and optimize?

**Before Final Mission**:
17. Can I design hierarchical systems?
18. Do I understand distributed coordination?
19. Can I handle failures gracefully?
20. Am I confident integrating everything?

**Scoring**:
- **17-20 Yes**: You're ready!
- **13-16 Yes**: Review weak areas, then proceed
- **9-12 Yes**: Spend more time on current mission
- **<9 Yes**: You're moving too fast; revisit prerequisites
