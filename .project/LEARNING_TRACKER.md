# Learning Tracker - Spaced Repetition System

> **Purpose**: Track concepts and skills you're learning, schedule reviews for optimal retention.
>
> **Based on**: Spaced repetition research - review at increasing intervals for long-term memory.
>
> **Target Length**: ~100-200 lines (archive mastered concepts to keep it manageable)

## üìä Review Schedule Overview

**Spaced Repetition Intervals**:
- **Day 1**: Learn concept (initial exposure)
- **Day 2**: First review (24 hours later)
- **Day 4**: Second review (2 days later)
- **Day 8**: Third review (4 days later)
- **Day 15**: Fourth review (7 days later)
- **Day 30**: Fifth review (15 days later)
- **Day 60**: Mastery check (30 days later)

**Intervals adjust based on recall difficulty:**
- ‚úÖ **Easy recall**: Use longer interval
- üòê **Medium recall**: Stick to schedule
- ‚ùå **Hard recall**: Shorten interval, review sooner

## üéØ Active Learning (In Progress)

> Concepts currently being learned and reinforced

### Concept: Goroutines

**Category**: Core Concurrency Primitive

**Status**: üå± Learning (Boot Camp)

**Learned On**: [To be filled when you start]

**üí∞ Point Value**: See table below for goroutine-related implementations

**What It Is**:
Lightweight threads of execution managed by the Go runtime. Goroutines are cheap to create (you can spawn thousands), making concurrent programming practical and elegant.

**Why It Matters**:
Goroutines are the foundation of all concurrency in Go. You can't build concurrent systems without understanding how they work, when to use them, and how to manage their lifecycle.

**How We Use It**:
```go
// Basic goroutine spawning
go myFunction()

// With WaitGroup for coordination
var wg sync.WaitGroup
wg.Add(1)
go func() {
    defer wg.Done()
    // Do work concurrently
}()
wg.Wait()

// In this project: each Unit runs as a goroutine
go unit.run(ctx) // Unit lives independently
```

**Key Insight**:
Goroutines are like casting creature spells in MTG or training units in SC:BW‚Äîonce spawned, they exist independently. But unlike game units, goroutines need explicit lifecycle management (no automatic cleanup!).

**Connected To**:
- OS threads (but much lighter weight)
- JavaScript async functions (but with true parallelism)
- MTG: Casting creatures (they resolve and exist on battlefield)
- SC:BW: Training units (they're produced and act independently)

**Review Schedule**:
- ‚è≥ Day 1: Learn concept (during Boot Camp)
- ‚è≥ Day 2: First review
- ‚è≥ Day 4: Second review
- ‚è≥ Day 8: Third review
- ‚è≥ Day 15: Fourth review
- ‚è≥ Day 30: Fifth review
- ‚è≥ Day 60: Mastery check

**Practice Exercises**:
- [ ] Spawn 1000 goroutines and observe memory usage with pprof
- [ ] Create a goroutine leak intentionally, then detect and fix it
- [ ] Implement proper cleanup using context cancellation
- [ ] Build a worker pool with fixed number of goroutines
- [ ] Race two goroutines and understand the non-determinism

**Real-World Applications** (Count: 0):
- (Will track as you implement in types.go, units.go, etc.)

**Point Opportunities**:
| Implementation | Base Points | Category |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| Unit.run() goroutine loop | 60 pts | Advanced (lifecycle) |
| Worker pool implementation | 50 pts | Advanced (coordination) |
| Concurrent event processing | 30 pts | Advanced |
| Context-based shutdown | 35 pts | Advanced (cleanup) |

**Resources**:
- CONCEPTS_GUIDE.md (Goroutines section)
- Effective Go: Goroutines
- Go blog: Share Memory By Communicating

---

### Concept: Channels

**Category**: Core Concurrency Primitive

**Status**: üå± Learning (Boot Camp)

**Learned On**: [To be filled when you start]

**üí∞ Point Value**: See table below for channel-related implementations

**What It Is**:
Typed conduits for communication between goroutines. Channels can be unbuffered (synchronization point) or buffered (asynchronous queue up to capacity).

**Why It Matters**:
Go's philosophy: "Don't communicate by sharing memory; share memory by communicating." Channels are THE way goroutines coordinate and exchange data safely.

**How We Use It**:
```go
// Unbuffered: synchronous handoff
ch := make(chan int)
go func() {
    ch <- 42 // Blocks until someone receives
}()
value := <-ch // Receives (unblocks sender)

// Buffered: asynchronous up to capacity
eventCh := make(chan Event, 100)
eventCh <- event // Doesn't block until buffer full

// With select: multi-channel operations
select {
case msg := <-ch1:
    // Handle ch1
case ch2 <- value:
    // Send to ch2
case <-time.After(time.Second):
    // Timeout
}
```

**Key Insight**:
Channels are like the MTG stack‚Äîthings resolve in order, timing matters. Unbuffered channels = instant priority pass (synchronous). Buffered = stack with capacity (asynchronous).

**Connected To**:
- Queues (but with built-in synchronization)
- MTG stack (ordered resolution, LIFO for stack, FIFO for channels)
- SC:BW command queue (units execute orders in sequence)
- Unix pipes (data flows through pipeline)

**Review Schedule**:
- ‚è≥ Day 1: Learn concept
- ‚è≥ Day 2: First review
- ‚è≥ Day 4: Second review
- ‚è≥ Day 8: Third review
- ‚è≥ Day 15: Fourth review
- ‚è≥ Day 30: Fifth review
- ‚è≥ Day 60: Mastery check

**Practice Exercises**:
- [ ] Build a 3-stage pipeline using channels
- [ ] Experiment with different buffer sizes and observe blocking behavior
- [ ] Create a deadlock with channels, understand why, then fix it
- [ ] Implement fan-out/fan-in pattern
- [ ] Use select to handle multiple channels with timeout

**Real-World Applications** (Count: 0):
- (Will track uses in battle simulator, command system, etc.)

**Point Opportunities**:
| Implementation | Base Points | Category |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| Command handling with channels | 15 pts | Intermediate |
| Channel pipeline (3+ stages) | 40 pts | Advanced (composition) |
| Select with timeout/cancel | 30 pts | Advanced |
| Event pub/sub system | 55 pts | Advanced (architecture) |
| Priority queue with channels | 45 pts | Advanced (algorithm) |

### Concept: Mutexes (sync.Mutex / sync.RWMutex)

**Category**: Core Synchronization Primitive

**Status**: üå± Learning (Boot Camp)

**Learned On**: [To be filled when you start]

**üí∞ Point Value**: See table below for mutex-related implementations

**What It Is**:
Mutual exclusion locks that protect shared data from concurrent access. Only one goroutine can hold a mutex at a time (Lock). RWMutex allows multiple readers OR one writer.

**Why It Matters**:
Prevents data races‚Äîthe most common and dangerous bug in concurrent programs. Mutexes are essential when you need to protect shared state.

**How We Use It**:
```go
type SafeCounter struct {
    mu    sync.RWMutex
    count map[string]int
}

func (s *SafeCounter) Inc(key string) {
    s.mu.Lock()         // Exclusive access
    defer s.mu.Unlock() // Always unlock
    s.count[key]++
}

func (s *SafeCounter) Value(key string) int {
    s.mu.RLock()        // Shared read access
    defer s.mu.RUnlock()
    return s.count[key]
}
```

**Key Insight**:
Mutexes protect DATA, not code. Only hold the lock while accessing shared state. It's like MTG priority‚Äîonly one player can modify the board at a time, but multiple can look.

**Connected To**:
- Semaphores (but simpler, binary lock)
- MTG priority (only active player modifies game state)
- SC:BW mineral patch (only one worker mines at once)
- Database locks (row-level locking)

**Review Schedule**:
- ‚è≥ Day 1: Learn concept
- ‚è≥ Day 2: First review
- ‚è≥ Day 4: Second review
- ‚è≥ Day 8: Third review
- ‚è≥ Day 15: Fourth review
- ‚è≥ Day 30: Fifth review
- ‚è≥ Day 60: Mastery check

**Practice Exercises**:
- [ ] Create a data race intentionally, detect with `-race`, fix with mutex
- [ ] Compare sync.Mutex vs sync.RWMutex performance with benchmarks
- [ ] Create a deadlock through improper lock ordering, then fix it
- [ ] Minimize critical section to improve performance
- [ ] Build a thread-safe cache with RWMutex

**Real-World Applications** (Count: 0):
- (Will track uses in resource manager, unit state, etc.)

**Point Opportunities**:
| Implementation | Base Points | Category |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| Unit state getters (RWMutex) | 15 pts | Intermediate (concurrency) |
| Unit state setters (RWMutex) | 15 pts | Intermediate (concurrency) |
| Thread-safe cache | 30 pts | Advanced |
| Resource pool with locking | 165 pts | Complex System (Mission 2) |

**Practice Exercises**:
- [ ] [Specific exercise]

**Real-World Applications** (Count: 0):
[Will add as you use it]
```

### Conducting a Review

**Review Process:**

1. **Claude asks recall question** (without looking at notes):
   - "Can you explain how [concept] works?"
   - "What's the key insight about [concept]?"
   - "How would you apply [concept] to solve [new problem]?"

2. **You attempt to recall** from memory

3. **Rate your recall**:
   - ‚úÖ **Easy**: Remembered everything, explained clearly ‚Üí Use longer interval
   - üòê **Medium**: Remembered most, needed minor prompts ‚Üí Stick to schedule
   - ‚ùå **Hard**: Struggled to recall, needed significant help ‚Üí Shorten interval

4. **Update the tracker**:
   ```markdown
   - ‚úÖ Day 8 (2024-03-22): Third review - Recall: Medium
   - üìÖ Day 15 (2024-03-29): Fourth review - **DUE NEXT SESSION**
   ```

5. **Apply the concept**: If possible, use it in current work

### Review Interval Adjustments

**Based on recall difficulty:**

| Recall | Current Interval | Next Interval |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| Easy | 2 days | 4 days |
| Medium | 2 days | 3 days |
| Hard | 2 days | 1 day |
| Easy | 4 days | 7 days |
| Medium | 4 days | 5 days |
| Hard | 4 days | 2 days |

**Pattern**: Easy = 2x interval, Medium = 1.5x interval, Hard = 0.5x interval

### Marking as Mastered

**Mastery Criteria** (all must be met):
- ‚úÖ Completed 6+ reviews successfully
- ‚úÖ Applied in real code 5+ times
- ‚úÖ Can explain clearly without notes
- ‚úÖ Can apply to new problems independently
- ‚úÖ Can teach it to someone else

**When mastered:**
1. Update status to ‚úÖ Mastered
2. Add to "Recently Mastered" section
3. Archive to `/archive/mastered-concepts/YYYY-MM-DD-[concept-name].md`
4. Keep a reference line in CLAUDE.md if frequently used

## Success Metrics

**This tracker is working when:**
- ‚úÖ You remember to review concepts at scheduled times
- ‚úÖ Recall improves with each review
- ‚úÖ Concepts successfully applied in real code multiple times
- ‚úÖ You feel confident explaining concepts without notes
- ‚úÖ Learning feels systematic, not random

**Needs adjustment if:**
- ‚ùå Reviews feel like a chore (make them more interactive)
- ‚ùå Recall isn't improving (shorten intervals)
- ‚ùå Too many concepts tracked (focus on fewer at a time)
- ‚ùå Reviews aren't happening (improve session start routine)
- ‚ùå File exceeds 250 lines (archive mastered concepts)

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Add every tiny thing you learn (focus on key concepts)
- Skip reviews (defeats the entire purpose)
- Mark as mastered too early (need proof through application)
- Let file grow indefinitely (archive mastered concepts)
- Review passively (actively recall, don't just re-read)
- Track too many concepts at once (5-10 active is ideal)

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Add concepts that are important to master
- Stick to the review schedule consistently
- Require multiple real-world applications before mastery
- Archive to keep file manageable
- Use active recall for reviews
- Focus depth over breadth (master few things well)

---

**Remember**: Spaced repetition works because of the spacing. The intervals are based on research into how memory works. Trust the system, stick to the schedule, and watch your retention soar! üöÄ
