# üèÜ Rating System - Your Ladder Climb

> *"Just like climbing from Rank E to S in SC:BW, mastering concurrency is measured not by time spent, but by skills demonstrated. Every implementation earns points. Every concept mastered moves you up the ladder."*

---

## üéØ System Overview

This project uses a **point-based rating system** modeled after StarCraft: Brood War ladder ranks. You start at **1150 points** (Rank E) and climb through implementations, concept mastery, and problem-solving.

### Why Points Matter:
- **Tangible Progress**: See exactly how far you've come
- **Motivation**: Each implementation moves you closer to the next rank
- **Fair Recognition**: More complex work = more points
- **Learning Focus**: Points reward understanding, not just completion

## üí∞ Point Value Tables

**NOTE**: Point values have been **aggressively calibrated** to ensure total earnable points is ~**1,355**, making the maximum achievable score **2,505** (just above Rank S at 2,500). Every implementation matters!

### Category 1: Simple Methods (2-6 pts)

### Category 4: Complex Systems (120-260 pts)

**Expected Total**: ~935 points for all major systems

**NOTE**: These point values assume full, working implementations. Partial implementations earn proportional points.

---

### Category 5: Integration & Mastery (300+ pts)

## üìâ Decay Mechanics

**Philosophy**: First-time implementations teach the most. Repetitions reinforce but have diminishing returns. NEW complexity restores full points.

### Decay Formula:

```
Points Earned = Base Points √ó Multiplier

1st implementation:  100% (1.00x multiplier)
2nd implementation:   85% (0.85x multiplier)  ‚Üê 15% decay
3rd implementation:   72% (0.72x multiplier)  ‚Üê ~15% decay
4th implementation:   61% (0.61x multiplier)  ‚Üê ~15% decay
5th+ implementation:  Floor at 25% minimum
```

### Examples:

**Simple Method (Base: 5 pts)**
- 1st time: 5 √ó 1.00 = **5 pts**
- 2nd time: 5 √ó 0.85 = **4 pts**
- 3rd time: 5 √ó 0.72 = **4 pts**
- 4th time: 5 √ó 0.61 = **3 pts**
- 5th+ time: 5 √ó 0.25 = **1 pt** (floor)

**Intermediate Method (Base: 15 pts)**
- 1st time: 15 √ó 1.00 = **15 pts**
- 2nd time: 15 √ó 0.85 = **13 pts**
- 3rd time: 15 √ó 0.72 = **11 pts**
- 4th time: 15 √ó 0.61 = **9 pts**
- 5th+ time: 15 √ó 0.25 = **4 pts** (floor)

**Advanced Pattern (Base: 60 pts)**
- 1st time: 60 √ó 1.00 = **60 pts**
- 2nd time: 60 √ó 0.85 = **51 pts**
- 3rd time: 60 √ó 0.72 = **43 pts**
- 4th time: 60 √ó 0.61 = **37 pts**
- 5th+ time: 60 √ó 0.25 = **15 pts** (floor)

---

### ‚ú® Complexity Facet Reset

**What counts as "new complexity facet"?**

If your implementation adds **significant new complexity** that requires new learning, you get **FULL points** again.

**Examples**:

‚úÖ **FULL POINTS** (new facet):
- First worker pool: 50 pts
- Worker pool with **dynamic resizing**: 50 pts (new complexity!)
- Worker pool with **priority scheduling**: 50 pts (new complexity!)
- Worker pool with **backpressure handling**: 50 pts (new complexity!)

‚ùå **DECAYED POINTS** (same pattern):
- First worker pool: 50 pts
- Second worker pool (same pattern, different use case): 43 pts (85%)
- Third worker pool (same pattern again): 36 pts (72%)

**Judgment Call**: When in doubt, ask yourself: "Did I learn something NEW, or just apply what I already knew?" New learning = full points.

## üéÅ Bonus Multipliers

**Stack with base points** for additional recognition.

### Success Bonuses:

| Achievement | Multiplier | Notes |
|-------------|------------|-------|
| **First Attempt Success** | +10% | Compiled & ran correctly first try |
| **No Hints Used** | +20% | Solved without looking at hints |
| **Used Only Hint 1** | +10% | Minimal scaffolding needed |
| **Used Hints 1-2** | +5% | Moderate scaffolding |
| **Used All 3 Hints** | +0% | Full scaffolding (still learned!) |

### Mastery Bonuses:

| Achievement | Multiplier | Notes |
|-------------|------------|-------|
| **Explain Concept Back** | +25% | Successfully taught concept to Claude |
| **Found & Fixed Bug** | +5-15% | Improved existing code |
| **Optimization** | +10-20% | Made code faster/better |
| **Creative Solution** | +15% | Novel approach not suggested in hints |

### Special Achievements:

| Achievement | Flat Bonus | Notes |
|-------------|------------|-------|
| **Clean Race Detector** | +25 pts | First run, no data races |
| **Zero Goroutine Leaks** | +30 pts | Proper cleanup verified |

| **All Tests Pass** | +20 pts | When you write tests yourself |

**Bonuses Stack**: If you implement something first try (+10%), without hints (+20%), and explain it back (+25%), you get **+55% bonus**!

**Example**:
```
Position.Distance() = 12 base points
First attempt success: +10% ‚Üí 13 pts
No hints used: +20% ‚Üí 14 pts
Explained concept: +25% ‚Üí 15 pts
Clean race detector: +25 pts flat ‚Üí 40 pts total!
```

## üéÆ How to Use This System

### Daily Workflow:

1. **Before Implementation**:
   - Check current rank and points
   - Review base points for upcoming work
   - Consider bonus opportunities

2. **During Implementation**:
   - Try without hints first (+20% bonus!)
   - Aim for first-attempt success (+10% bonus)
   - Think about explaining it back (+25% bonus)

3. **After Implementation**:
   - Update "Points Earned This Session" table
   - Note multiplier for this pattern type
   - Update running total
   - Check progress to next rank

4. **Session End**:
   - Calculate total points earned
   - Update "Current Rating" section
   - Move detailed history to archive if table gets too long
   - Celebrate progress! üéâ

---

## üìä Rank Distribution (Goal)

This is what distribution SHOULD look like when you're done:

```
Rank F:  Never here (you start at E)
Rank E:  Boot Camp beginning ‚Üí 10% of journey
Rank D:  Mission 1 or 2 ‚Üí 20% of journey
Rank C:  Missions 1 & 2 ‚Üí 35% of journey
Rank B:  Mission 3 ‚Üí 50% of journey
Rank A:  Mission 4 ‚Üí 70% of journey
Rank S:  Final Mission ‚Üí 100% complete (MASTER!)
```

**Difficulty Curve**: Notice how rank brackets get WIDER as you progress. This reflects that later missions are worth more points, and mastery takes longer.

---

## üéØ Point Philosophy

**Remember**:
- Points measure **skills demonstrated**, not time spent
- Higher points = more complex patterns mastered
- Decay encourages breadth AND depth (learn many patterns, but apply them)
- Bonuses reward **understanding**, not just implementation
- The goal isn't to min-max points‚Äîit's to learn deeply

**Flash's Wisdom**:
> "I don't play to climb the ladder. I play to master the game. The rank follows naturally."

**Your Approach**:
> "I don't code to earn points. I code to master concurrency. The rank follows naturally."

---

## üîÑ System Maintenance

### Archiving:

When "Points Earned This Session" exceeds ~30 rows:
1. Move old entries to `archive/rating-history/YYYY-MM.md`
2. Keep current session + last 2 sessions visible
3. Maintain running total

### Adjustments:

If you find points too easy/hard to earn:
- **Too easy**: Increase decay rate or reduce base points
- **Too hard**: Decrease decay rate or add more bonuses
- Document changes in ADR-004 in CLAUDE.md
